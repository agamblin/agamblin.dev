At Masteos, I had the pleasure to work on internal tools. My internship main focus was to develop a user-friendly interface for construction materials ordering, on top of an existing GraphQL API. I was in charge of the front-end development, using **React** and **TypeScript**. I also worked on the back-end, using **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL**.
