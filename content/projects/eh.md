Esport-Hatcher is a project that I carried out with a team of 7 other developers as part of the **Epitech Innovative Project** program. The vision of this project is to meet the needs of e-sports team management, which often requires mastery of numerous tools. Esport-Hatcher aims to centralize these tools by offering a customizable and intuitive application.
